# UiPath – Flow Sequence: Repeat, While, and Do While Loops

This repository contains a UiPath workflow that demonstrates how to:

- Use **Repeat**, **While**, and **Do While** loops in a **Flow Sequence**
- Increment and track a counter variable through each loop
- Display the results in the **Output Panel** or **Message Box**

---

## 📘 Project Overview
- Built using **UiPath Studio (Modern Design Experience)**
- Demonstrates usage of **Assign**, **Repeat Number of Times**, **While**, and **Do While** activities  
- Ideal for learning loop control and flow logic in UiPath

## ⚙️ Workflow Logic

### 🔹 Assign
Initializes a counter variable:

### 🔹 Repeat Number of Times
Executes a set of actions 3 times:

### 🔹 While Loop
Repeats the process while the counter is less than 6:

### 🔹 Do While Loop
Executes at least once and continues while the counter is less than 9:

### 🔹 Final Log Message
Displays the final counter value:

---

## 🧩 Example Output
Repeat Loop → Counter = 1

Repeat Loop → Counter = 2

Repeat Loop → Counter = 3

While Loop → Counter = 4

While Loop → Counter = 5

While Loop → Counter = 6

Do While Loop → Counter = 7

Do While Loop → Counter = 8

Do While Loop → Counter = 9

Final Counter = 9

##  Result
The program executed successfully and displayed the loop outputs in the UiPath Output Panel.
